# counting-cranes

This repository contains the code for my research with William & Mary's Institute for Integrative Conservation (IIC), the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (USFWS), and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). Applying deep learning approaches from the object counting literature, I aim to streamline the monitoring process for sandhill cranes.
