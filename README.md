# counting-more-cranes

This work is a continuation on the work of [Luz-Ricca et al. (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1002/rse2.301) and is in partnership with the William & Mary Institute for Integrative Conservation, the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, and the U.S. Geological Survey. This repository implements new methods relevant towards operationalization of automated counting of sandhill cranes using thermal, aerial survey.

The Python version used for the original codebase is `Python 3.7`.
