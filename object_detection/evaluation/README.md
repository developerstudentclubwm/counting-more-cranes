To compute the metrics of an object detection model,
one can use this [open source toolbox for object detection metrics](https://github.com/rafaelpadilla/review_object_detection_metrics).

This code is from the following [GitHub repository](https://github.com/johschmidt42/PyTorch-Object-Detection-Faster-RCNN-Tutorial) and contains minor tweaks from the original toolbox's source code.
